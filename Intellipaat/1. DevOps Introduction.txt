DevOps is a software development methodology which improves the collaboration
between developers and operations team usng various automation tools. These
automation tools are implemented using various stages which are a part of Devops Lifecycle

Dev:
continuous development
- Plan 
- Code
continuous testing
- Build
- Test

-->output docker to ops

#CI

Ops:
continuous deployment
- Release (internal release, eksternal release)
- Deploy (automating test on server)
continuous monitoring
- Operate (operating the code end-to-end on software)
- Monitor

--> using docker


#ContinuousIntegration:
Cdev -> CTes -> #CI -> CDep -> CMon -> #CI -> Cdev ~

1. CDev: This is stage involves commiting code to version control tools
such as Git or SVN. For maintaining different version of the code, and tools like
Ant, Maven, Gradle for building/packaging the code into executable file that
can be forwarded to the QAs for testing
Tools: Git

2. Cintegration:The stage is a critical point in the whole DevOps Lifecycle. It deals with integrating
the different stages of the devops lifecycle, and is therefore the key in automating the whole
Devops Process.
Tools: Jenkins

3. CDeployment: In this tage the code is built, the environment of the application 
is containerized and is pushed on the desired server. The key processess in this stage
are Configuration Management, Virtualization, and Containerization
Tools: Docker, Puppet, Ansible

4. CTest: The stage deals with automated testing of the application pushed by the developer.
If there is an error, the message is sent back to the integration tool, this tool in turn notifies
the developer of the error. If the test was a success, the message is sent to integration tool which
pushed the build on the production server
Tools: Selenium

5. CMonitoring: the stage continuously monitor the deployed application for bugs or crashed. It can
also be setup to collect user feedback. the collected data is then sent to the developers to improve
the application

-------
DevOps Tools Description:
- Jenkins: is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human
part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspect 
of continuous delivery

- Nagios: is an open-source devops tools which is used for monitoring systems, networks and infrastructure.
It also offers monitoring and alerting services for any configurable event.
- Kubernetes
- Git: is a Distributed version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating
work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software 
development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of file.
- Docker: Virtualization & Containerization
- Puppet: Configuration Management
- Ansible: Configuration Management
- Selenium: is a portable software-testing framework used for web applications. It is an open source tool
which is used for automating the tests carried out on web browsers (Web Application are tested using
any web browser)
